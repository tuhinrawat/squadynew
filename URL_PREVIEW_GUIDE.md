## 💡 Tips for Best Previews

### 1. Add Auction Descriptions
When creating or editing an auction, add a description (up to 160 characters recommended):

```
✅ Good: "Join the Annual Premier League auction featuring 50+ top cricket players. Real-time bidding starts May 15th!"

❌ Too Long: "This is a very long description that goes on and on and on..." (gets truncated)
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Auction Names
The slug is generated from your auction name:

```
✅ Good: "IPL 2024 Auction" → /auction/ipl-2024-auction
✅ Good: "Corporate Cricket League" → /auction/corporate-cricket-league
❌ Generic: "Test" → /auction/test
```

### 3. Keep Names Readable
Extremely long names create long URLs:

```
⚠️ Long: "Assetz 63 East Mens Premier Cricket League 2026 Auction"
     → /auction/assetz-63-east-mens-premier-cricket-league-2026-auction

✅ Better: "Assetz 63 East Cricket 2026"
       → /auction/assetz-63-east-cricket-2026
```
